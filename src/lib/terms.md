**Stacknote is an application that can create long sentences by stacking short sentences like a chat application. It makes your writing surprisingly efficient.**

## Features

### 1. Stack cards

In Stacknote, you can stack blocks and build a document. That's just like a chat app's UI. That's blocks are called `card`. This idea is came from author's habit of taking notes in chat app and github issues's comment area.
